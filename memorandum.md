# Memorandum
Stake Capital is excited to announce the launch of BlackPool; a new fund operating within the digital sport marketplace.
<br />Since its launch in 2018, Stake Capital has been the driving force behind several highly successful trading and arbitrage mechanisms for non-fungible assets (NFTs). 

<br />BlackPool is the first decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) built solely for digital sport trading. 
As the first in its field, BlackPool will lead the way in providing financial derivatives to the digital sports marketplace, by offering services such as asset valuation indices, leasing, insurance mechanisms, and more.
BlackPool’s home ground will be the SoRare fantasy football system, where a diverse strategy will maximise shareholder returns, while benefiting the whole SoRare ecosystem.

<br />This will include scouting for new and upcoming athletes, investing in star players and managers, and being an active player in the transfer market.

<br />This strategy could be compared to that of Chelsea FC, where Roman Abramovich invested over 1 billion pounds in purchasing valuable players in order to loan them to other teams. From a business perspective, his strategy has proven to be incredibly successful. The loan system benefits not only the loanee, but also the parent and recipient clubs.

<br />In the world of fantasy football NFTs, the best cards are often the scarcest ones on the market. These can only be obtained by paying a high price, or by winning them as rewards, which would require already having great players on your team. The average spend of SoRare users is high (several $ETH), and the top 25 users own approximately half of the current global cards market cap, which currently stands at around $1 million, according to [SorareData.com](https://SorareData.com).

<br />As a strong advocate of decentralisation, BlackPool aims to provide managers with the tools they need to succeed in the market by offering data-driven strategies which will maximise their profits and help them spot opportunities for arbitrage.

<br />BlackPool will level the playing field through loans, lotteries, and other in-depth trading strategies and solutions. This will benefit the entire ecosystem, as every member will have increased access to rarer, higher quality players, which will in turn increase supply distribution and encourage new users to join the game.

<br />Composed of people from all backgrounds, we believe that our approach should reflect the wide spectrum of skills and knowledge that we have to offer. BlackPools strategies will be based on our long-term passion for football, while combining professional data analytics and machine learning to provide the best returns for our users.

<br />This combination of skills and knowledge means BlackPool will be able to track live data from prominent sports journalists, and use information on injuries, contract extensions and player performance to our advantage.


<br />While Blackpool’s strategy is clearly to be a dominant figure into the transfer market, our decision-making will always be done in respect of regulations. BlackPool’s vision is to provide value to SoRare and therefore willthereforso will not play against any potential Decentralised Financial Fair Play Regulations (DFFPR). BlackPool’s core values will remainare still: improve the economic and financial capabilities of SoRare fantasy football managers. 

<br />#Decentralized Financial Fair Play Regulations
In June 2020, Faced by serious and worsening financial conditions in the NFT world, Blackpool's Executive Board of Directors unanimously approved a Decentralised Financial Fair Play concept to improve the game's well-being. This concept, developed and supported by the entire NFT gaming family, recognises the need for world-wide action to restrict some of the worst excesses of the game. It's fundamental principles and objectives are to:

• Improve the economic and financial capability of the clubs, increasing their transparency and credibility;
• Protect creditors and ensure that clubs settle their liabilities with employees, social/tax authorities and other clubs punctually;
• Introduce more discipline and rationality in club football finances;
• Encourage clubs to operate on the basis of their own revenues;
• Promote responsible spending for the long-term benefit of football;
• Protect the long-term viability and sustainability of its stakeholders.

(These are fantasy principles and so are not legally binding)
