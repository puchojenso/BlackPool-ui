BlackPool is a new fund in the NFT industry, managing a range of assets from sports cards to game items to digital art.<br />

BlackPool is the first decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) built solely for NFT gaming and trading. Our strategies will be based on our long-term passion for gaming and art, as we combine professional data analytics and machine learning to provide the best returns for our users.<br />

We will lead the way in providing financial derivatives to digital marketplaces, by offering services such as asset valuation indices, leasing, insurance mechanisms, and more.<br />
BlackPool firmly believes in the long term value of scarce digital assets, and understand that a high level of specialisation in each NFT platform is required to maximise value creation. Therefore, we will always seek to employ expertise to improve our performance on each platform.<br />
BlackPool generates cashflows and accrues value for the DAO by:<br />

- taking arbitrage opportunities between primary and secondary markets 
- loaning out assets 
- buying and selling assets based on news 
- scouting for assets that will accrue in value and buying early 
- in-game competition
